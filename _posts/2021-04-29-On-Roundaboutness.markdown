Throughout the pandemic the US issued an economic relief totalling 4 TUSD in an assortment of loans, grants and tax breaks. That sums to about 20% of their 2020 GDP.

If a Goverment Budget is `Taxes - Expenses`, what does this non-trivial deficit mean and how should it affect my economic choices?

To rationalize intervention, I turned my eye to those who argue against it -- the Austrian Economists. 

Introductory reads are the obvious way to gauge my interest and future time commitment for a topic, so I picked the book **The Dao of Capital: Austrian Investing in a Distorted World**.

The following are broad market observations from an Austrian perspective. The intention is to build intuition first and develop a positional statement second.
 
**Roundaboutness** 

A central idea is that to increase the chances of winning against your competition, immediate and direct tactics tend to be ineffective. 
Roundaboutness means to cede ground now in favor of creating the **means** for a decisive attack in the future. 
Squaring this idea with capital it'd be something like this: 
- Use today's gains as means to secure future progress and not as a payment of past performance. 
- Capital structures serve to exploit disequilibirums in the economy, making intertemporal tradeoffs allows you to build the means to satisfy the consumer (focusing on the means rather than the ends).

**On the human desire for immediacy (aka Hyperbolic Discounting)** 

The intuition is that humans have a the temporal bias for immediacy, which is a propensity to assign more value to the most available, salient and tangible to us. This bias helps explain 1) how we assign value temporally (now >> later), and, 2) our miscalculated ability to carry out in the future what today seems doable (eg. I'll start exercising next monday, instead of today).

Human nature then is the systematic source of investment mispricing which is ripe for intertemporal arbitrage.

**Austrian Primitives.** 

Statistics and history are tools for deduction, not truth themselves. 

Intervention distorts the markets efficiency to find equilibrium, rather than calming them as intended.
