Throughout the pandemic the US issued an economic relief totalling 4 TUSD in an assortment of loans, grants and tax breaks. That sums to about 20% of their 2020 GDP.

This got me thinking, how can I rationalize this non-trivial intervention and should this factor in my future economic choices? 

Two ideas followed: 1) I don't have a mental model on monetary intervention, and, 2) **anything other than the gifts of nature we will end up paying for**.

On 1, I thought I'd start somewhere so I turned my eye to Austrian Economics whom I remember, argument against state monetary intervention. With a copy of **The Dao of Capital: Austrian Investing in a Distorted World** I got on with it for answers.

The following are ideas I found interesting in the book, most of which don't help respond my questions above but serve as good frameworks to think about my actions.

**On being roundabout.** The central intuition is that to increase the chances of winning against your competition, immediate and direct tactics tend to be ineffective. 
Roundaboutness (or going left in order to go right) is a more effective strategy. It means to cede ground now in favor of creating the **means** for a decisive move in the future. This is a framework to think about capital and profit. 

Use today's gains as means to secure future progress and not as a payment of past performance. 
Capital structures serve to exploit disequilibirums in the economy, making intertemporal tradeoffs allows you to build the means to satisfy the consumer (focusing on the means rather than the ends).

**On the human desire for immediacy.** The temporal bias for immediacy responds to the pleasure principle (Freud), which is a propensity to assign more value to the most available, salient and tangible to us. This bias helps explain 1) how we assign value temporally, and, 2) our miscalculated ability to carry out in the future that today seems doable (eg. I'll start exercising next monday).

Human nature then is the systematic source of investment mispricing which is ripe for intertemporal arbitrage.

**Austrian Ideas** Statistics and history are tools for deduction, not truth themselves. Intervention distorts the markets efficiency to find equilibrium, rather than calming them as intended.
