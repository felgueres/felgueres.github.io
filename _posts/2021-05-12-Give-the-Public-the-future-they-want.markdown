There's this idea that humans make economic decisions considering two axes, monetary incentives and their identity.

Identity is a reflection of what we value, which we build by association and action (eg. the palces you visit, the clothes you buy, the artists you support).

If someone was to ask you, what is your identity, it's uncomfortably hard to come with an answer.
Perhaps because we hate to talk about ourselves or perhaps because our actions our driven by intuition and not careful examination.

The beautiful thing about markets is they will give you what you want if you tell them.

My belief is that these identities are the moldings of our future. 

Unexamined asks will likely result in a future that optimizes for the near-sighted, the immediate, the fleeting.

I'm imagining a tool that can help us make sense of our identities to transalate intuitions to facts.
