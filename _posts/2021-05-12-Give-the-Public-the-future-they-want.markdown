There's this idea that humans make economic decisions considering two axes, monetary incentives and their identity (wikipedia on economic identity).

Our identity is a reflection of what we value, which we build by association and through action. 

But if someone was to ask you, what is your identity, it's uncomfortably hard to come with an answer. Perhaps because we hate to talk about ourselves or perhaps because most of our action and values our driven by intuition and not careful thought. 

I believe that the distinction between what you think your identity is and how that translates in the multiplayer game we are playing, is fundamentally molding the future. 

Concretely, I'm thinking about how we influence companies to build products for us.

The beautiful thing about markets is they will give you what you want if you tell them.

So what is the future that we want?
