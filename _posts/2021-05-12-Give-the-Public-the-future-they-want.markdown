Economic decisions are guided by two considerations, monetary incentives and a sense of identity ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_economics)).

Identity is a reflection of our values and beliefs which we build by association and action (eg. the places we visit, the clothes we wear, the artists we support).

But if I asked you, what is your identity? It's uncomfortably hard to come up with an answer.

Perhaps because we hate to talk about ourselves or perhaps because our actions are largely driven by intuition and not by careful examination.

My belief is that these identities mold the future by influencing how markets serve us. 

That's the beautiful thing about markets, they give you what you want.

Consequentially, poorly articulated or unexamined asks will likely result in a future that optimizes for what is most natural for humans; near-sightedness and fleeting pleasures.

If you could ask for the future, do you know what to ask for? 

What if there was a tool that helped us understand these identities? 

A tool that could turn our intuitions into facts.
