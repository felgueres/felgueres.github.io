We make economic decisions using two guiding considerations, monetary incentives and our sense of identity.

Identity is a reflection of our values and beliefs which we build by association and action (eg. the places we visit, the clothes we wear, the artists we support).

If I ask you, what is your identity? It's uncomfortably hard to come up with an answer.

Perhaps because we hate to talk about ourselves or perhaps because our actions are largely driven by intuition and not by careful examination.

A beautiful thing about markets is that they will give you what you want.

My belief is that over time, these identities are the moldings of our future by influencing the supply side of all transactions.

Consequentially, a lack of articulation or worse, unexamined asks, will likely result in a future that optimizes for the near-sighted, the immediate and the fleeting.

Could we do better than that? 

Imagine a tool that can help us make sense of our identities to translate intuitions into facts.
