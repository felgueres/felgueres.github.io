We make economic decisions using two guiding considerations, monetary incentives and our sense of identity.

Identity is a reflection of our values and beliefs which we build by association and action (eg. the places we visit, the clothes we wear, the artists we support).

If I ask you, what is your identity? It's uncomfortably hard to come up with an answer.

Perhaps because we hate to talk about ourselves or perhaps because our actions are largely driven by intuition and not by careful examination.

The beautiful thing about markets is they will give you what you want (if you tell them).

My belief is that these identities are the moldings of our future. Consequentially, unexamined asks will likely result in a future that optimizes for the near-sighted, the immediate, the fleeting.

We can do better than that. I'm imagining a tool that can help us make sense of our identities to transalate intuitions into facts.
