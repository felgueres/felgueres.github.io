Humans lust is profound and has not borders. 
Incest, murder, treason, lies, cruelty; any possible incarnation of wrongdoing has been practiced at all levels of society. 
This is no less stranger to kings and popes than it is to peasants.

Absolutism is at the core of dogmatic institutions like Christianity. 
The ideas they hold cannot be challenged, are held as truth, there's no place for error bars.
This property prevents good ideas to nourish.

What are good ideas anyway? 
Good ideas explain a phenomena with least information possible where every detail matters in combination. This means that a good idea is hard to vary. 
Good ideas stand for themselves; a credentialed narrator is not needed to voice their truth.
Good ideas by definition can only be good relative to bad ones.
Good ideas are placeholders until new evidence modifies their likelihood of being true.
(This is broadly inspired in the Beginning of Infinity).

Take a presient issue today: the enheightened sence of morality that people feel.
Where is this coming from? Is this a way to fill in the void left by an increasing departure from traditional religion? Let's draw an analogy from Christianity. 

When Martin Luther denounced the excesses of Christian leaders, it factionized the Church. 
People were left with the choice of selecting their faith. 
It went from a top-down decision to a democratized decision.

New leaders emerged and with them, countless dogmas. The result? The greatest division and death not across groups of people but within the not so long familiar.

What went wrong, why does it matter?

I believe crypto is all it promises. It promises an immutable ledger, promises to be censor resistant, promises to be the technology that defuses the monopoly of violence from the nation state. 
I think cryptography will deliver. The question is do we want it to? 

What factions will this create? DAOs.
Will these factions become confrontational? 
Is rationality dooming to the future?
It has been said that the greatest mistake of the wise is to assume that intelligent people are rational.
