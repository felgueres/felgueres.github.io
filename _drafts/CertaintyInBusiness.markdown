>> Computers do what they're told and nothing else. -- Linus Torvalds 

This is the axiom on which the future of human transactions will be based.

### Infrastructure for Negotiation.

Why? 

Efficiency is irresistible, that gets built. 
Human agreements are based on established rules, imagine a legal contract. 

What's the problem? 

Determining truth is expensive. 

That process is to:
0) Define Rules
1) Data Collection
2) Data Interpretation
3) Incorporate assessment 

What can be done differently?

1) Data Collection. This is the primitive to find resolution. Without data, you don't have information, without information, there's only opinion. 
Opinion's are subjective and partial, therefore undeterministic, therefore riskier.

Risk trickles down the cost stucture of a product or service and ends up being passed to the consumer.
 
2) Data Interpretation.  

Multiple possibilities:
- Voting mechanism to resolve a dispute across several 3rd parties or analysis 
- Discrete rule evaluation.

3) Resolution Mechanism

Questions:

Is there a theory around uncertainty and cost?
- 2-axes, plot uncertainty vs. cost. The more uncertainty the higher the cost. What's the relationship? Is it exponential? Is it linear?

Would insurance companies be incentivized to fund this effort?

How can this fail? 

If the incentive of companies is not to maximize cost efficiency (eg. FutureSun).

Why is this important for humans?
Because it levels the information asymmetry across parties and promotes fairness and an equality in the world. Think of Mexico and lawyers.  

What's the inefficiency cost over disputes?

WHAT CAN A PROTOCOL DO HERE?

- Protocols out there?
